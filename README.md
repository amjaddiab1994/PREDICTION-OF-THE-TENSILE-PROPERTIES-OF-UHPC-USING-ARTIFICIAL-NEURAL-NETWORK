# PREDICTION-OF-THE-TENSILE-PROPERTIES-OF-UHPC-USING-ARTIFICIAL-NEURAL-NETWORK
A multi-layer perceptron artificial neural network (MLP-ANN) was developed for calculating the cracking stress, the tensile strength, and the strain at tensile strength of UHPC, using as input the mix design parameters and the strain rate during testing. This tool is envisioned to provide reference values for direct tension test results performed on UHPC specimens, or to be employed as a framework to determine the tension response characteristics of UHPC in the absence of experimental testing, with minimal computational effort to determine the tensile characteristics.

The results showed an increase of the cracking tensile stress and the tensile strength for higher strain rates, whereas the strain at the tensile strength was unaffected by the strain rate.
